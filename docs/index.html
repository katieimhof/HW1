    <h1>Homework 1 Submission</h1>
    <p>I <em>hope</em> to get better at coding in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I also am hoping to get better about concising my code in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, because when I was coding over the summer for research, I think I could've had less lines of code. </p>
